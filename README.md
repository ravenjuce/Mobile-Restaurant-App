# Mobile Restaurant App

After mastering the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I independently followed the Figma blueprint to build a website. This project is a mobile restaurant menu that reads data from a file called `data.js` and renders the menu dynamically. Users can click the 'Add' button to place an order, which will then appear at the bottom of the screen. The 'Remove' button in the order section allows users to delete items they no longer want. Upon clicking the 'Complete' button, a small window pops up, prompting users to enter their card information and make a payment. After the payment is completed, the user's name appears with the order confirmation.

## Main Features

5. **Payment Process**:
